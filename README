This Project develop a new SiRGFL algorithm as a novel personalised FL methods. This MPhil Dissertation Project is supported by Supply chain AI Lab and FLower Lab from University of Cambridge. 

And this project is divided into four tasks

1. Data analysis and preprocessing
2. Simularity-based Ranking and Grouping methods in FL
3. Model Training (Local learning, Centralised learning, Tradition FL leaning and SIRGFL learning)
4. Data Visualization
