This Project is to develop a novel personalized federated learning method and apply it to a supply chain demand forecasting task in case study. The dissertaion project is supported by Supply Chain AI Lab and Flower Lab from University of Cambridge

The structure of the project is follows.
1. Data-preprocessing and feature engineering
2. SiRGFL (similarity-based ranking and grouping federated learning) algorithm
3. Experiemnts settings for model_training
4. Resuts visualization
